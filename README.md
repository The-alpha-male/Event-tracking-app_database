# Event-tracking-app_database using [Postgres.new](Postgres.new)

Postgres.New is a browser-based platform that allows for the quick creation and management of Postgres databases with AI assistance.The platform allows for incremental design modifications based on user prompts, facilitating dynamic database creation.
Visualization features enable users to generate insights and graphs from their database queries easily.

In this project I used [Postgres.new](Postgres.new) to create a database for an event tracking application.
